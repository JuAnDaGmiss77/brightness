## PyInstaller
##### Overview

The `pyinstaller` command is a utility for converting Python scripts into standalone executables. The provided documentation covers the usage of specific options, including `--onefile` and `--noconsole`, with a sample command:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole script.py
```

##### Options
###### `--onefile`
The `--onefile` option bundles the entire Python application into a single executable file. This simplifies distribution by providing a single file that contains all necessary dependencies and the main script.

###### `--noconsole`
The `--noconsole` option instructs PyInstaller not to create a console window when the executable is run. This is useful for GUI applications where a console window is unnecessary. It hides the console window, providing a cleaner and more professional user experience.

##### Sample Command
The provided sample command demonstrates the use of both options:
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole script.py
```
This command generates a standalone executable (`script.exe`) with all dependencies included and without displaying a console window during execution.

##### Considerations

- Distribution:The resulting executable can be distributed independently without the need for Python installation.
- Console Interaction: When using `--noconsole`, be aware that console interactions (e.g., print statements) won't be visible unless redirected to a file.
- File Size: The `--onefile` option may increase the size of the executable compared to other PyInstaller options.
